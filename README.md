# Talk: React Router and Optimizing Code Delivery by Val G.

React Router is an essential tool to write React applications. It provides a way for us to declaratively define our application flow, and compose our React components keeping our UI in sync with the URL. As part of the talk we will build a small app that utilizes React Router and introduces the power of this library.

The single page app (SPA) model for large enterprise applications can be tricky. We want snappy performance when the app is running in the browser, but we do not want our customer to wait while all the code is downloaded to the browser. In the second part of the presentation we will look at different ways of optimizing single page apps. We will be talking about code splitting and lazy loading, asset fingerprinting, vendor code chunks and long term caching.

Val G. is a principal software developer at Concur (SAP company). For the last 2 years he has been working on React/Node UI infrastructure developing building blocks, components and processes for creating enterprise grade React UIs.
